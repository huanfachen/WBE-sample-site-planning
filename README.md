# WBE_sample_site_selection
This repo contains code and data for the site selection of wastewater-based epidemiology, in order to maximise (total) population coverage or prioritise deprived population. 

There are two code files:

1. **estimate_population.ipynb**: code for generating the datasets of **UK_UWWT_geospatial_population_estimates.csv** and **catchment_IMD_2019_pop.csv**. Please note that this notebook has lots of dependencies. You can skip this notebook and simply use the existing datasets that are in the data folder.
2. **WBE_site_selection_maximise_coverage.ipynb**: code for site selection. 

Two datasets are used:

1. **UK_UWWT_geospatial_population_estimates.csv**: this dataset was generated by linking Urban Waste Water Treatment (UWWT) data and wastewater catchment geospatial data. See 
2. **catchment_IMD_2019_pop.csv**: this dataset was generated by linking wastewater catchment geospatial data and IMD 2019 data.
